The website was created on the basis of Filip Mamcarczyk's course on the YouTube platform: [Jak zacząć programować?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opNgrPv3Qw8)

This is an example of a false data resume created for the course. Icons from the website [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) were used in the project
